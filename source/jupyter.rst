Install Jupyter and Jupyter-lab
-------------------------------

We will make extensive use of Jupyter-lab to document work and to take
notes. You will also need to use Jupyter-lab as a notebook that you will
submit at the end of the semester for your final project. To install
them, type in your terminal:

``conda install jupyter``

and

``conda install jupyterlab``

You will have to type “y” when you are prompted for confirmation after
typing these commands. Now these tools should be installed in your
command line environment.

How to use Jupyter-lab?

I will be demonstrating its use during class.

Tools to install for next week
------------------------------

Using ``conda``, you will need to install a few tools that we will be
using during class next week. The tools are:

-  sra-tools
-  fastqc
-  bbmap

Using examples I have shown above, search and install these three tools
on your computer.
