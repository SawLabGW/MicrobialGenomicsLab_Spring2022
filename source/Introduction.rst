Introduction
============

Welcome to the Microbial Genomics Laboratory course for the Spring 2022
semester at The George Washington University! This is a computer-based
lab course which will teach you how to use latest and free computational
tools to analyze microbial genomes and metagenomes.

Detailed course syllabus for the course can be found here:

About this documentation
------------------------

This documentation system includes a collection of instructions on
computational exercises designed for you throughout the semester. It is
impossible to properly display the html pages of these instructions on
Blackboard. In order to display the pages correctly, you will need to
download the files through our course Github repository, which is
located here:

https://github.com/SawLabGW/MicrobialGenomicsLab_Spring2022

However, in order for you to see this repository, you will need to
create a Github account and let me know your username and email used to
create an account there. Only then can I add you into the list of people
allowed to view the pages and files there.

You cannot download the contents of this page just simply through this
web address but they need to be “cloned” to your computer through a
special command known as ``git``. We will be setting up these necessary
commandline tools during the first week of class.
