Introduction to the course
--------------------------

This week, due to the spike in Omicron variant of the SARS-CoV-2, we
will be meeting virtually on WebEx.

There will be a Powerpoint presentation given over WebEx or Zoom. I will
go over the details of how the class will be taught and what platforms
we will be using in the Powerpoint presentation but I outline below
these for you to remember.

Classroom location
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

When weâ€™re not meeting virtually, we will be meeting physically in the
basement of Rome Hall. The classroom is located in **Rome B104**.

Where is the virtual classroom?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

We will be meeting either on **WebEx** and/or **Zoom** platforms,
depending on how well they work. WebEx record time stamps of when a
person enters and leaves the room so it helps me to use WebEx for
recording attendance. Currently, the WebEx link for the class is shown
below.

Besides the virtual classroom, what else will we be using?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Besides using either WebEx or Zoom, we will use **Slack** to
communicate, discuss, and disseminate information such as reading
materials, videos,code snippets, etc. You will get an invitation to join
a Slack group created for this course. While Blackboard works fine, due
to the cross-listed nature of the course, it becomes very difficult to
organize content across both courses on Blackboard. We will use
Blackboard for grading and submission of assignments but for sharing of
content, we will use Slack.

We will also be using **Github** to share certain course content that
cannot be easily shared on Blackboard. For example, the computational
instructions you are seeing now was shared through a Github repository.
Therefore, you will need to create an account on Github website and let
me know your account information so that I can add you as a member of
the course and you will be able to download course materials.

Computational instructions will be updated on a weekly basis and will be
available on Wednesday at noon. You will need to use ``git pull``
command to update course repository and will be able to view the updated
instructions each week.
