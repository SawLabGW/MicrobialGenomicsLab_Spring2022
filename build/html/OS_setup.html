<h1>Setting up your computing environment<a class="headerlink" href="#setting-up-your-computing-environment" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h1>
<p>Computational exercises you will be performing in this course require
operating systems (OS) with Unix or Linux-like commands. This means you
needs to set up your environment to make sure those commands are
avaiable in a commandline environment, for example a terminal window. It
is <strong>crucial</strong> that you set this up correctly/properly as the course
heavily relies on tools that need to be run in command line environment.</p>
<p>The following sets of instructions will help you to set up your
environment correctly to make sure that these sets of commands are
available. If you are already using Linux or Unix operating system (OS),
then you are all set. If not, you will want to follow the instructions
to configure your environment.</p>
<div class="section" id="windows-os">
<h2>Windows OS<a class="headerlink" href="#windows-os" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Your Windows OS should already come installed with Windows Powershell
(if the OS version is fairly recent), which you will need for the
following instructions.</p>
<p>You will need to turn on Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL) feature on in
order to enable and run Unix/Linux commands natively on Windows
operating system. You can follow instructions on this page on how to set
up and configure your Windows OS to enable Unix commands:</p>
<p><a class="reference external" href="https://www.howtogeek.com/249966/how-to-install-and-use-the-linux-bash-shell-on-windows-10/">https://www.howtogeek.com/249966/how-to-install-and-use-the-linux-bash-shell-on-windows-10/</a></p>
<p>and here:</p>
<p><a class="reference external" href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install-win10">https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install-win10</a></p>
<p>Please follow the instructions shown in both pages I have referred to
above. WSL would allow you to use <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">bash</span></code> and Unix commands natively in
Windows OS. You will also have an opportunity to install a Linux
distribution as shown in both pages. I would highly recommend that you
choose Ubuntu as the distribution as it is more widely used and has more
user support than other distributions.</p>
<p>Briefly, the steps described in those two websites involve the
following:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>enabling WSL on Windows Features</p></li>
<li><p>installing a Linux distribution system (Ubuntu, for example) on
Windows</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Some instructions require that you run the Windows Powershell in
administrator mode. To do that, you need to right click on the Windows
Powershell icon to display other options and select the option that says
“run as Admin” or something similar.</p>
<p>Setting up the command line environment for Windows can be a bit
challenging compared to Mac OS but it is not impossible.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="mac-os">
<h2>Mac OS<a class="headerlink" href="#mac-os" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Setting up the command line environment in Mac is a lot easier as Mac OS
evolved from BSD, which is an offshoot of earlier Unix operating
systems. Consequently, there are more Unix-like tools already built into
the operating system. Nevertheless, it is not quite the usual GNU
Unix/Linux type of commands you might want to use. In order to set up
the environment correctly, follow the instructions below.</p>
<p>This website has pretty good instructions (although a bit old) on how to
set up the command line environement without having to install the whole
Xcode, which is usually a precursor needed to install command line tools
and requires a large space.</p>
<p><a class="reference external" href="https://mac-how-to.gadgethacks.com/how-to/install-command-line-developer-tools-without-xcode-0168115/">https://mac-how-to.gadgethacks.com/how-to/install-command-line-developer-tools-without-xcode-0168115/</a></p>
<p>Basically, you would first:</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li><p>Open your terminal</p></li>
<li><p>Then type this: <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">xcode-select</span> <span class="pre">--install</span></code></p></li>
<li><p>Then follow the instructions from the pop-up windows and it should
install the necessary tools for the command line environment.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>A few additional websites on how to set up the command line environment
on Mac OS are shown below:</p>
<p><a class="reference external" href="https://osxdaily.com/2014/02/12/install-command-line-tools-mac-os-x/">https://osxdaily.com/2014/02/12/install-command-line-tools-mac-os-x/</a></p>
<p><a class="reference external" href="https://www.maketecheasier.com/install-command-line-tools-without-xcode/">https://www.maketecheasier.com/install-command-line-tools-without-xcode/</a></p>
<p>Once the steps shown in these pages are followed, your command line
environment should be ready for this course.</p>
<div class="section" id="install-homebrew">
<h3>Install Homebrew<a class="headerlink" href="#install-homebrew" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>Next, you want to install Homebrew, which allows you to use the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">brew</span></code>
command on your Mac OS terminal. It is a package managing system that
allows you to install basic utilities and even some bioinformatics tools
on your Mac without needing admin privileges.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>First, go here and follow the instructions:
(<a class="reference external" href="https://docs.brew.sh/Installation">https://docs.brew.sh/Installation</a>)</p></li>
<li><p>Open your terminal</p></li>
<li><p>Then type:</p></li>
</ul>
<div class="highlight-default notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="n">cd</span>

<span class="o">/</span><span class="nb">bin</span><span class="o">/</span><span class="n">bash</span> <span class="o">-</span><span class="n">c</span> <span class="s2">&quot;$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)&quot;</span>

<span class="n">brew</span> <span class="n">install</span> <span class="n">coreutils</span> <span class="n">findutils</span> <span class="n">gnu</span><span class="o">-</span><span class="n">tar</span> <span class="n">gnu</span><span class="o">-</span><span class="n">sed</span> <span class="n">gawk</span> <span class="n">gnutls</span> <span class="n">gnu</span><span class="o">-</span><span class="n">indent</span> <span class="n">gnu</span><span class="o">-</span><span class="n">getopt</span> <span class="n">grep</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>The first <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">cd</span></code> commands takes you back to your home directory where
you want to be installing Homebrew. The rest of the commands shown will
install GNU Unix commands, which are different from original Unix-like
commands that come installed with Mac OS.</p>
<p>Once Homebrew is installed, it will be very easy to install other tools
such as <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">git</span></code>, which you will need to check out the course Github code
repository and see the instructions. Remember, <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">brew</span></code> command is your
best friend on any Mac OS to install and configure tools you would need
for pretty much anything.</p>
